High Priority / Core Functionality Issues:

Implement Auto-Connect for Warpcast Wallet:
Problem: User explicitly has to click "Connect Wallet" (1:42). The reviewer strongly suggests a seamless experience using Warpcast's embedded wallet ("Warplet").

Action: Leverage the Farcaster frame context or Thirdweb SDK capabilities to detect if the user is in an environment with an available wallet (like Warpcast) and attempt to connect automatically or with minimal friction. Hide the explicit "Connect Wallet" button when connection is automatic/already established.

Dynamic Farcaster Frames per Market:
Problem: The user clicked a generic frame ("GoForecast") (2:09). They suggest frames should represent specific market questions to be more engaging.
Action: Modify the Farcaster frame generation logic (page.tsx metadata and potentially a dedicated API route) to create frames specific to individual prediction markets. Include the market question and potentially current odds/status directly in the frame image/buttons.

User Experience & Onboarding Improvements:

Display User PFP & Username:
Problem: The app doesn't feel personalized; it lacks user context (1:26).
Action: Once the wallet is connected (ideally automatically), fetch the user's Farcaster profile information (PFP, username) using their FID or connected address. Display this prominently in the UI (e.g., header) to show the user they are "logged in".

Improve Initial Clarity/Purpose:
Problem: User initially had no idea what the app does (0:00 - 0:12).
Action: Refine the text/description used when sharing the app (especially in the generic Farcaster frame if one remains, or in general app metadata) to clearly state it's a prediction market.
Distinguish Market States Clearly:
Problem: User noted some markets were active, others "pending resolution" (0:45 - 1:04). While identifiable, the distinction could be clearer.
Action: Enhance the UI to visually differentiate between Active (bettable), Pending Resolution (ended, awaiting outcome), and Resolved markets.
Performance & Visual Polish:

Optimize Load Time & Responsiveness:
Problem: Loading time was "really long" (0:16), and the app felt "a little bit slow" overall (1:54).
Action: Analyze bundle size, component rendering, data fetching strategies (e.g., use loading states, optimize queries), and image loading. Use Next.js performance tools (like next/dynamic for imports, image optimization) and browser dev tools to identify bottlenecks.
Visual Consistency (Icon vs. Splash):
Problem: Minor detail, but the splash screen didn't match the cat icon (0:16).
Action: If using a splash screen or distinct loading visual, ensure it aligns thematically/visually with the app's icon/branding.
Summary of Reviewer's Core Desire:

The reviewer wants a seamless, mobile-first prediction market experience integrated directly with the Warpcast ecosystem (using its embedded wallet), addressing the friction points of traditional platforms like Polymarket. Fixing the core betting functionality and improving the Farcaster frame integration are key to achieving this.

This is a solid list to work from! Which of these points do you want to tackle first? I'm ready to dive into the code specifics for any of them.
